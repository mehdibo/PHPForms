Your help is really appreciated, all contributions are welcome.
If you find a bug or have a suggestion, please make sure there is no already open/closed issue.

# Pull Requests
If you send a Pull request, that's great! here are the guidelines to get it accepted

## Documentation
If your PR changes something and requires a Documentation change make sure you change the PHPDoc blocks and Update any enty in the [Repo's wiki](https://github.com/mehdibo/PHPForms/wiki)

## Testing
If you add a new feature or change something that requires a test make sure you add/update the test.

## One issue at a time
Limit the pull request to one fix/feature so that if a feature is not desired we can still benefit from other fixes.

## Branching
All pull requests need to be sent to the "develop" branch.
